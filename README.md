## Exercise: Slack and GitHub Accounts (5 Points)

The name of this exercise is **Slack and GitHub Accounts**.

The purpose of this assignment is to create accounts for these services. We will use these services through out the term to communicate and submit assignments.

If you already have accounts for Slack and GitHub using your Pipeline email address, then all you need to do is join the vcc-csv13-fall2018 team on Slack submit your GitHub account name to the [#github-questions](https://vcc-csv13-fall2018.slack.com/messages/github-questions) channel on Slack.

**Please be sure to use your pipeline email account for these services**

The **first thing you should do** is create a Slack account by accepting the invitation I sent to each of you at the beginning of the term. The invitation looks like this (except with information about CS140 for Fall 2018):

If you're trying to add this class and did not receive an invitation click [here](https://vcc-csv13-fall2018.slack.com/signup) to sign up. Remember to use your pipeline email account.

Click **Join team** and fill in the username and password on the invitation page. Click **Next** and that's it! You've created your Slack account and join the vcc-csv13-fall2018 team. 

You can either explore Slack's tutorial by clicking **Explore Slack** or click **Skip the tutorial** at the bottom of the page and begin sending messages to any of the available channels. 

You can download clients for Android or iOS on your mobile devices, or stay signed on using the webpage. We'll use this service through out the course to communicate. I will send information about upcoming assignments or any changes to the [#general](https://vcc-csv13-fall2018.slack.com/messages/general). **I will not send emails to the class, I will send messages to #general**

Feel free throughout the term to create channels to communicate with your classmates, or communicate directly with them. All messages are archived and accessible by me. Therefore, conduct yourself accordingly. 

Once you've explored a little bit, move on to the next step and create a GitHub account and join the vcc-csv13-f2018 organization.

The **second thing you should do** is create a GitHum account. If you use your pipeline email account you do not need an invitation. If, however, you want to use an existing GitHub account that is not associated with your Pipeline account, send me a message on slack in [#github-questions](https://vcc-csv13-fall2018.slack.com/messages/github-questions) with your GitHub username or email address. I will then send you an invitation as soon as possible.

To create a new account go to the [GitHub](http://www.github.com) website and you should see:

![GitHub website](https://github.com/sbcc-cs140-fall2018/Course-Information/wiki/images/ex00/github-signup.png)

Now do the following:

1. Choose and enter a username for GitHub and put it in **Pick a username** field.

2. Enter your email address, preferably your Pipeline email, in the **Your email** field.

3. Create and enter a password for GitHub and put it in **Create a password**

4. Click **Sign up for GitHub**

That's it! You now have a GitHub account. This account will act as a repository for all your project in this class and any subsequent class you feel like adding code from. In the future when you look for jobs in industry you can think of this account as portfolio of work you've done. It is now common to send your GitHub repository as part of your resume.

Now you need to join the vcc-csv13-fall2018 organization. I have to send you an invitation, so you need to send me your GitHub username using Slack. Go to the [#github-questions](https://vcc-csv13-fall2018.slack.com/messages/github-questions) and send me your GitHub username. I will generate the invitation and it will be sent to your email address associated with your GitHub account.

Follow the directions in the invitation and you will be a member of the organization on the students team. 

To verify that you have joined the organization properly, go to the next assignent in GitHub by clicking [this link](https://github.com/vcc-csv13-fall2018/csv13-ex01-helloworld). If you _do not_ get a **404 Not Found** error, then you have joined the organization properly and are done with this assignment.
